# LunarLander

Education workshop developed to allow students to build an understanding of reinforced learning. In the workshop the students learn aspects of machine learning required to land a lunar lander. Step by step they can build an AI and see it working. The workshop takes around 2 hours and is intended to be run on Chromebooks. 

In addition there is a particular focus on how to measure the 'fitness' of this AI.
