# Lunar Lander Workshop

This repo contains an education workshop developed to allow students to build an understanding of reinforced learning. In the workshop the students learn aspects of machine learning required to land a lunar lander which is part of the OpenAI Gym environment. Step by step they can build an AI and see it working. The workshop takes around 2 hours and is intended to be run on Chromebooks. 

In addition there is a particular focus on how to measure the 'fitness' of the resulting AI.
